# Credits

Thanks to the numerous tutorials out there (will add the list soon!) and all the awesome extensions by Mads Kristensen! For this particular extension I started out with the Error Highlighter extension.

https://github.com/madskristensen/ErrorHighlighter. 

This extension pretty much single handedly helps you getting started on developing visual studio extensions. I will add more to this file as and when I figure out what else I am missing!
